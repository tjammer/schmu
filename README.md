A WIP toy programming language to learn about type systems and LLVM

This is the beginnig of a small functional language I am currently working on.
The goal is to start with the simply typed lambda calculus and go from there. Eventually I would like a reasonably fast ML-like language without runtime garbage collection.

### Working
* Let bindings
* Named and anonymous functions
* Functions with multiple arguments
* If-then-else
* Hindley-Milner type inference
* First class functions
* LLVM IR codegen and object file creation
* Declaration of external C functions
* Downward closures
* Records

### WIP
* Polymorphism

### TODO
* Algebraic data types + pattern matching
* Some kind of memory management (RC?)
* Anything else
