A WIP toy programming language to learn about type systems and LLVM

This is the beginnig of a small functional language I am currently working on.
The goal is to start with the simply typed lambda calculus and go from there

### Working
* Let bindings
* Named and anonymous functions
* Functions with multiple arguments
* If-then-else
* Hindley-Milner type inference
* First class functions
* LLVM IR codegen and object file creation
* Declaration of external C functions

### TODO
* Closures
* Records
* Helpful error messages
* Anything else
